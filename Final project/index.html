            <h5>Light Shabbat Candles</h5>
            <p>
              Women and girls (age 3 and up) are encouraged to light candles
              every Friday afternoon, 18 minutes before sunset, in honor of the
              Shabbat, and before Festivals.

            <h5>Tefillin</h5>
            <p>
              Men (age 13 and up) are encouraged to wear the Tefillin every
              morning excluding Shabbat and Festivals. Tefillin are black
              leather boxes containing small parchment scrolls of selected
              portions from the Torah, in which the fundamentals of the Jewish
              faith are inscribed.

            <h5>Mezuzah</h5>
            <p>
              Every Jewish home should have a mezuzah on its doorposts. The
              mezuzah contains the Shema and is a sign that the home is
              sanctified for G‑d and enjoys His protection.

            <h5>Torah</h5>
            <p>
              Study a portion of Torah daily. Even a few lines contain the
              infinite wisdom and will of G‑d.

            <h5>Tzedakah</h5>
            <p>
              Give charity daily. When you give to the needy, you are serving as
              G‑d's emissary to provide for His creations. The home is a
              classroom, and keeping a"pushkah" (charity box) inyour home — and
              contributing a coin to it every day — will teach you and your
              children the noble value of regular giving.

            <h5>A home filled with holy books</h5>
            <p>
              Furnish your home with as many holy books as possible. At the very
              least, get a hold of a Chumash (Bible), Psalms, and a Prayer Book.

            <h5>Kashrut</h5>
            <p>
              Eating is one of the basics of life. Shouldn't it be done with
              intelligence? For a healthy and sound soul, eat only kosher foods,
              for when you eat differently, your Judaism is not just
              metaphysical, but part and parcel of your very being.

            <h5>Love Your Fellow</h5>
            <p>
              "Love your fellow as youself," said the great Jewish sage Rabbi
              Akiva, is a most basic principle in the Torah. Reaching out to
              your fellow Jew with patience, love, concern and unity is among
              the greatest mitzvot a Jew can do.

            <h5>Education</h5>
            <p>
              Every Jewish boy and girl should receive a Jewish education. Teach
              your children everything you know about your faith, and provide
              them with a quality Jewish education — you will be ensuring Jewish
              integrity, Jewish identity and a Jewish future.

            <h5>Observe Family Purity</h5>
            <p>
              Observance of the Jewish marital laws allows you to make the most
              of your marriage, bringing you and your spouse to new,
              undiscovered depths of intimacy and sacredness in your
              relationship.
